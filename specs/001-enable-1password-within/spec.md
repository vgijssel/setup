# Feature Specification: 1Password Kubernetes Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-enable-1password-within`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Enable 1Password within Kubernetes clusters so other components can read secrets safely and enabling easy key rotation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: When a secret is rotated in 1Password, how should Kubernetes workloads receive the updated value? ‚Üí A: Workloads automatically restart to pick up new secrets
- Q: How should the system control which workloads can access which secrets? ‚Üí A: Namespace-based (all workloads in a namespace share same secret access)
- Q: How should workloads consume secrets retrieved from 1Password? ‚Üí A: Both environment variables and mounted files
- Q: When 1Password is unavailable during secret retrieval, what should happen to workloads? ‚Üí A: Use cached secret values from previous successful retrieval
- Q: Which types of secrets should the system support retrieving from 1Password? ‚Üí A: All types including structured data (JSON, YAML configurations)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Kubernetes cluster administrator or application developer, I need to securely access secrets stored in 1Password from within my Kubernetes workloads so that sensitive credentials are centrally managed, automatically rotated, and not hardcoded in configuration files or environment variables.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a secret exists in 1Password, **When** a Kubernetes workload requests that secret, **Then** the secret value is retrieved and made available to the workload securely
2. **Given** a secret is rotated in 1Password, **When** the rotation occurs, **Then** Kubernetes workloads automatically restart and receive the updated secret value
3. **Given** a Kubernetes workload is deployed with secret references, **When** the workload starts, **Then** it can access the required secrets from 1Password before becoming ready
4. **Given** multiple Kubernetes clusters exist, **When** each cluster is configured for 1Password integration, **Then** each cluster can independently access secrets from 1Password based on its authorization

### Edge Cases
- What happens when 1Password is unavailable or unreachable during secret retrieval? System uses cached secret values from previous successful retrieval.
- What happens when a workload starts for the first time and 1Password is unavailable (no cache exists)?
- How does the system handle workloads that start before the 1Password integration is ready?
- What happens if a secret is deleted from 1Password but still referenced by a workload?
- How are permission errors handled when a cluster tries to access secrets it's not authorized to retrieve?
- What occurs when secret rotation happens while a workload is actively using the old secret value? Workload automatically restarts.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enable Kubernetes workloads to retrieve secrets from 1Password vaults
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect when secrets change in 1Password and trigger workload restarts to propagate updated values
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to secrets by enforcing namespace-based permissions where all workloads within a namespace share the same secret access rights
- **FR-004**: System MUST support exposing secrets to workloads as both environment variables and mounted files
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle connection failures to 1Password gracefully by using cached secret values from previous successful retrievals
- **FR-006**: System MUST support multiple independent Kubernetes clusters, each with its own authorization to access 1Password vaults
- **FR-007**: System MUST audit secret access events including which namespace and workload accessed which secret and when
- **FR-008**: System MUST support retrieving all secret types from 1Password including plain text (passwords, API keys, tokens), binary data (certificates, SSH keys), and structured data (JSON, YAML configurations)
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that secrets exist and are accessible before providing them to workloads
- **FR-010**: System MUST automatically restart workloads when their referenced secrets are rotated in 1Password

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Secret Reference**: A reference from a Kubernetes workload to a specific secret stored in 1Password, including vault location, item name, and field identifier
- **1Password Vault**: A secure container in 1Password that holds one or more secrets, with associated access permissions
- **Kubernetes Workload**: Any pod, deployment, statefulset, or job that requires access to secrets from 1Password
- **Authorization Mapping**: The relationship between Kubernetes namespaces and their permitted access to specific 1Password vaults or items
- **Secret Rotation Event**: A change to a secret value in 1Password that triggers propagation to dependent Kubernetes workloads
