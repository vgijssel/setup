# Feature Specification: Countdown Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-web`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a web application with two pages. The first page a landing page with the blue organge logo and a 5 character secret. If the user guesses the secret correctly they will be redirected to the next page which is shows a large countdown timer. The countdown timer is counting down and showing days, hours, minutes and seconds. When the countdown timer is done the game will be begin."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: What is the 5-character secret code users must enter? ‚Üí A: "sorry" (case-sensitive, fixed hardcoded value)
- Q: What is the countdown target date and time? ‚Üí A: 2025-11-20 00:00 Europe/Amsterdam (fixed)
- Q: What happens when the countdown reaches zero (game begins)? ‚Üí A: Timer stops at 00:00:00:00, no other action (placeholder for future functionality)
- Q: Should the secret validation persist across page refreshes or browser sessions? ‚Üí A: No persistence - user must re-enter secret for each new visit/session
- Q: What happens when a user enters an input that is not exactly 5 characters? ‚Üí A: Submit button disabled until exactly 5 characters entered

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the web application and is presented with a landing page featuring a blue and orange logo. To proceed, they must correctly enter a 5-character secret code. Upon successful entry, they are redirected to a countdown timer page that displays the remaining time until a game begins, broken down into days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The countdown updates in real-time until it reaches zero, at which point the game starts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user navigates to the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the blue and orange logo is displayed prominently with an input field for the 5-character secret
2. **Given** the user enters an incorrect 5-character secret, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the system displays an error message and the user remains on the landing page
3. **Given** the user enters the correct 5-character secret, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the system redirects them to the countdown timer page
4. **Given** the user is on the countdown timer page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a large countdown timer displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds format
5. **Given** the countdown timer is running, **When** time elapses, **Then** the displayed values update automatically every second
6. **Given** the countdown timer reaches zero, **When** the timer expires, **Then** the timer displays 00:00:00:00 and stops updating

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters fewer or more than 5 characters in the secret field? (Submit button remains disabled)
- What happens if a user attempts to access the countdown timer page directly without entering the secret? (Redirected to landing page)
- What happens if a user refreshes the countdown timer page - does the timer persist or reset? (Timer continues if in same session, otherwise redirected to landing)
- What happens if the countdown has already expired when a user first accesses the timer page? (System displays 00:00:00:00)
- What happens if a user navigates away from the countdown page and returns later?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Landing Page
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a landing page as the entry point to the application
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a blue and orange logo on the landing page [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact logo design, dimensions, or asset reference not specified]
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an input field for users to enter a 5-character secret code
- **FR-004**: System MUST disable the submit button until exactly 5 characters are entered in the secret field
- **FR-005**: System MUST verify the entered secret matches "sorry" (case-sensitive)
- **FR-006**: System MUST display an error message when an incorrect secret is entered
- **FR-007**: System MUST redirect users to the countdown timer page upon successful secret entry

#### Countdown Timer Page
- **FR-009**: System MUST display a countdown timer showing remaining time until the game begins
- **FR-010**: System MUST format the countdown timer to show days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- **FR-011**: System MUST update the countdown display every second
- **FR-012**: System MUST count down to 2025-11-20 00:00 Europe/Amsterdam timezone
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to the countdown page without valid secret entry
- **FR-014**: System MUST stop the countdown at 00:00:00:00 when the target time is reached
- **FR-015**: System MUST display the countdown as 00:00:00:00 when the target time has passed
- **FR-016**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what constitutes "large" display - specific size requirements or visual prominence?]

#### General
- **FR-017**: System MUST NOT persist secret validation across browser sessions (user redirected to landing page on new visit)
- **FR-018**: System MUST redirect users to landing page if they attempt to access countdown page without valid secret entry in current session
- **FR-019**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multi-user access - can multiple users access simultaneously or is this single-user?]
- **FR-020**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: accessibility requirements - keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Secret Code**: The fixed case-sensitive value "sorry" required for access
- **Countdown Timer**: Time-based entity tracking remaining duration until 2025-11-20 00:00 Europe/Amsterdam
- **User Session**: Tracks authentication state after successful secret entry; no persistence across browser restarts
