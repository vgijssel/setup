# Feature Specification: Agent Fleet Management Interface

**Feature Branch**: `001-agent-fleet-interface`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application which acts as an interface to all my running agents. This interface is needed because it will be used by my agent-of-agent or superagent to control a fleet of other agents, check in on status, change assignments, etc."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-27

- Q: How does the interface detect agent failures (unresponsive agents)? → A: Explicit health checks - Interface actively polls agents at intervals; agent must respond to health check request within timeout
- Q: What communication protocol should the interface use to communicate with agents? → A: REST/HTTP with polling + WebSocket for events
- Q: What should happen when a task assignment fails due to agent going offline during the assignment process? → A: Return error immediately, mark task unassigned
- Q: What critical state information must be persisted for recovery after interface restart? → A: Agent registry only
- Q: How should the system handle simultaneous modification requests for the same agent from multiple sources? → A: Last-write-wins with conflict notification
- Q: What happens when a task assignment exceeds the agent's stated capabilities or resource limits? → A: Reject immediately with detailed error

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Agent Fleet Status (Priority: P1)

The superagent needs to view the current status of all agents in the fleet to understand overall system health and agent availability.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all management operations - before making any decisions or changes, the superagent must know what agents exist and their current state. Without this, no meaningful fleet management is possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by querying the interface for all agents and verifying that each agent's status (running, idle, busy, offline, error) is displayed accurately. Delivers immediate value by providing fleet visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the superagent is connected to the fleet interface, **When** it requests the list of all agents, **Then** it receives a complete list showing agent ID, name, current status, and last activity timestamp
2. **Given** an agent changes status from idle to busy, **When** the superagent queries the fleet, **Then** the interface reflects the updated status within 5 seconds
3. **Given** an agent goes offline unexpectedly, **When** the superagent checks fleet status, **Then** the agent is marked as offline with timestamp of last known activity

---

### User Story 2 - Check Individual Agent Details (Priority: P1)

The superagent needs to inspect detailed information about a specific agent to understand its current workload, capabilities, and operational history.

**Why this priority**: Once fleet visibility exists, the superagent needs deeper insight into individual agents to make informed decisions about task assignments and troubleshooting. This is essential for effective fleet management.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting any agent from the fleet and retrieving its detailed information including current assignment, task history, performance metrics, and capabilities. Delivers value by enabling informed decision-making.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the superagent has identified an agent from the fleet list, **When** it requests detailed information for that agent, **Then** it receives the agent's current assignment, task queue, capabilities, and performance metrics
2. **Given** an agent is actively working on a task, **When** the superagent checks its details, **Then** the interface shows real-time progress information and estimated completion time
3. **Given** an agent has completed multiple tasks, **When** the superagent views its history, **Then** the interface displays a chronological list of completed tasks with timestamps and outcomes

---

### User Story 3 - Assign Tasks to Agents (Priority: P2)

The superagent needs to assign new tasks or change existing assignments for agents in the fleet to distribute work effectively.

**Why this priority**: After establishing visibility and detailed inspection capabilities, the ability to assign work is the core operational function. This enables the superagent to actively manage and orchestrate the fleet.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a task assignment request for a specific agent and verifying that the agent receives the assignment and begins execution. Delivers value by enabling workload distribution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent is in idle status, **When** the superagent assigns a new task with required parameters, **Then** the agent transitions to busy status and begins task execution
2. **Given** an agent is already working on a task, **When** the superagent attempts to reassign it, **Then** the interface either queues the new task or requests confirmation to interrupt current work
3. **Given** a task assignment fails validation, **When** the superagent checks the result, **Then** the interface provides a detailed error message indicating why the assignment failed with specific information (e.g., agent offline, missing required capability "image-processing-v2", queue full, resource limit exceeded: requires 8GB RAM but agent has 4GB available)

---

### User Story 4 - Cancel or Modify Agent Assignments (Priority: P2)

The superagent needs to cancel ongoing tasks or modify existing assignments when priorities change or errors are detected.

**Why this priority**: Operational flexibility requires the ability to adapt to changing conditions. This enables the superagent to respond to errors, priority shifts, or resource constraints.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by assigning a task to an agent, then issuing a cancellation or modification request, and verifying the agent responds appropriately. Delivers value by providing operational control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent is executing a task, **When** the superagent sends a cancellation request, **Then** the agent stops the task gracefully and returns to idle status
2. **Given** an agent has multiple tasks queued, **When** the superagent modifies task priority, **Then** the agent reorders its queue accordingly
3. **Given** a task cannot be cancelled immediately, **When** the superagent requests cancellation, **Then** the interface indicates the task will be cancelled at the next safe checkpoint

---

### User Story 5 - Monitor Fleet Performance Metrics (Priority: P3)

The superagent needs to view aggregate performance metrics across the entire fleet to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.

**Why this priority**: While operational control is essential, aggregate metrics provide strategic insight for optimization. This is valuable but not critical for basic fleet management operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting fleet-wide metrics and verifying that aggregated data (task completion rates, average response times, resource utilization) is calculated and displayed correctly. Delivers value through optimization insights.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple agents are active, **When** the superagent requests fleet metrics, **Then** the interface displays aggregate statistics including total tasks completed, average task duration, and fleet utilization percentage
2. **Given** an agent is underperforming, **When** the superagent views performance metrics, **Then** outliers are highlighted for investigation
3. **Given** a time range is specified, **When** the superagent requests historical metrics, **Then** the interface displays trend data for the specified period

---

### User Story 6 - Receive Real-Time Alerts (Priority: P3)

The superagent needs to be notified immediately when critical events occur (agent failures, task errors, capacity thresholds reached) without constantly polling for status.

**Why this priority**: Real-time alerts improve responsiveness but are not required for basic operations. The superagent can still function effectively by periodically checking status.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering alert conditions (e.g., simulating agent failure) and verifying that the superagent receives notifications within defined time limits. Delivers value through proactive problem detection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent crashes unexpectedly, **When** the failure is detected, **Then** the superagent receives an immediate alert with agent ID and failure reason
2. **Given** a task execution exceeds timeout threshold, **When** the timeout occurs, **Then** the superagent is notified with task details and affected agent
3. **Given** fleet capacity reaches 90% utilization, **When** the threshold is crossed, **Then** the superagent receives a capacity warning alert

---

### Edge Cases

- **Resolved**: When the superagent attempts to assign a task to an agent that goes offline during the assignment process, the interface returns an error immediately to the superagent indicating the agent is offline, and the task remains unassigned and available for reassignment to another agent.
- **Resolved**: When simultaneous modification requests target the same agent from multiple sources, the system applies last-write-wins semantics with timestamps. All modifications are accepted, and if concurrent modifications are detected within a configurable time window, the system includes a conflict notification in the response to alert the requestor that another modification occurred.
- What happens when the fleet interface loses connection to one or more agents?
- How are agents that become unresponsive (not crashed, but not responding) detected and handled?
- **Resolved**: When a task assignment exceeds the agent's stated capabilities or resource limits, the interface validates the task requirements against the agent's registered capabilities before dispatching and immediately rejects the assignment with a detailed error message specifying which capability or resource limit was exceeded.
- How does the system handle agents that report contradictory status information?
- **Resolved**: When the interface restarts, it recovers the agent registry from persistent storage and queries each agent for current status and active tasks. Task state is not persisted by the interface; agents are responsible for reporting their current task assignments upon reconnection.
- How are time zone differences handled when displaying timestamps across geographically distributed agents?

## Assumptions *(include if relevant)*

- Agents are responsible for reporting their own status changes (idle to busy, task completion, etc.) proactively
- Agents support REST/HTTP endpoints for receiving commands and health checks, and maintain WebSocket connections for pushing real-time status updates and events to the interface
- Network connectivity between the interface and agents is generally reliable but can fail temporarily
- Task parameters are provided in a structured format that agents can parse
- Each agent has a unique identifier assigned at registration time
- The superagent is authorized to control all agents in the fleet (no per-agent access control required)
- Agents can operate independently and do not require constant communication with the interface
- Task execution is the responsibility of the agent - the interface only manages assignment and tracking
- Agents maintain their own task state and can report current assignments and task history when queried by the interface (e.g., after interface restart or reconnection)

## Out of Scope *(include if defining boundaries)*

- Implementation of the agents themselves - this specification covers only the management interface
- The internal logic of how agents execute tasks - agents are treated as black boxes
- User authentication and authorization for the superagent - assumed to be handled externally
- Billing or resource accounting for agent usage
- Agent deployment, provisioning, or infrastructure management
- Task scheduling algorithms or optimization strategies - the superagent makes assignment decisions
- Data storage or processing performed by individual agents
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures for agent data
- Multi-tenancy or isolation between different superagent instances managing separate fleets
- Agent code updates or version management
