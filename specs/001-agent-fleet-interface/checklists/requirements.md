# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent Fleet Management Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✓ **No implementation details**: The specification describes the interface in terms of capabilities and behaviors without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or programming languages.

✓ **Focused on user value**: All user stories clearly articulate the value to the superagent and why each capability is needed for effective fleet management.

✓ **Non-technical language**: The specification is written in plain language that a business stakeholder or product manager could understand without technical expertise.

✓ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, and Success Criteria sections are all fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✓ **No clarification markers**: The specification contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are stated definitively with reasonable defaults based on industry standards for distributed system management.

✓ **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-018) describes a specific, verifiable capability that can be tested independently.

✓ **Measurable success criteria**: All success criteria include specific metrics (time limits, percentages, counts) that can be objectively measured.

✓ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on observable outcomes (response times, notification delivery, concurrent connections) without specifying implementation technologies.

✓ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story includes 2-3 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format that cover normal flows.

✓ **Edge cases identified**: Eight edge cases are documented covering failure modes, concurrent operations, and state recovery scenarios.

✓ **Scope clearly bounded**: The "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes agent implementation, authentication, deployment, and other related concerns.

✓ **Dependencies and assumptions**: Eight assumptions are documented covering communication protocols, agent behavior, and system authorization.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✓ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement is specific enough to be implemented and verified independently.

✓ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: Six prioritized user stories cover the complete lifecycle from viewing status (P1) to receiving alerts (P3).

✓ **Measurable outcomes**: Ten success criteria define quantifiable performance targets and behavioral expectations.

✓ **No implementation leakage**: The specification maintains focus on WHAT the system does rather than HOW it will be implemented.

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, technology-agnostic, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

Key strengths:
- Well-prioritized user stories with clear independent testing criteria
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering core operations and error handling
- Specific, measurable success criteria with realistic performance targets
- Clear assumptions and scope boundaries

The specification successfully avoids implementation details while providing enough clarity for planning and design decisions.
