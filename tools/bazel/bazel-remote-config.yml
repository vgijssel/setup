# The server listener address for HTTP/HTTPS. For TCP listeners,
# use [host]:port, where host is optional (default 0.0.0.0) and can
# be either a hostname or IP address. For Unix domain socket listeners,
# use unix:///path/to/socket.sock, where /path/to/socket.sock can be
# either an absolute or relative path to a socket path.

# HTTP read/write timeouts. Note that these do not apply to the proxy
# backends or the profiling endpoint. Reasonable values might be twice

# likely blob. Units can be one of: "s", "m", "h".

# Specify a certificate if you want to use HTTPS:

#tls_ca_file: path/to/ca/cert.pem

# Alternatively, you can use simple authentication:
#htpasswd_file: path/to/.htpasswd

# If tls_ca_file or htpasswd_file are specified, you can choose
# whether or not to allow unauthenticated read access:
#allow_unauthenticated_reads: false

# If specified, bazel-remote should exit after being idle
# for this long. Time units can be one of: "s", "m", "h".
