## About Me

![About Me](./apps/docs/images/about-me.jpeg)

I am a passionate developer with a strong focus on delivering business value. I’m good at learning new languages, technologies and tools to innovatively solve new and existing problems. I have substantial subject matter experience in security, securing systems, data and CI/CD. I’m a natural problem solver with an easy personality who likes to get things done.
