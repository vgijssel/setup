# AGENTS.md

This monorepo follows an atomic design architecture for infrastructure and application code. Everything is orchestrated through the `task` CLI, with a clear directory layout for navigation and a strong set of conventions to keep things sharp and scalable.

---

## üóÇ Project Structure

Navigate the repo through the following top-level directories:

### `stacks/`
Defines full deployment environments (real or virtualized). For example:

- `enigma/`: Talos-based Kubernetes cluster
- `devenv/`: Local MacOS-based dev environment
- `provisioner/`: PiKVM machine provisioned using Ansible

### `services/`
Reusable Kubernetes service modules. For example:

- `argocd/`: GitOps engine
- `kubeovn/`: CNI plugin for overlay & VLAN networks
- `rook-ceph/`: Distributed storage platform

Each service includes manifests (Kustomize or Helm), optionally environment-agnostic by default.

### `apps/`
In-house applications built and deployed via services. For example:

- `home-assistant/`: Smart home automation platform
- `blog/`: Blog deployed with mkdocs to GitHub Pages
- `escaperoom/`: Streamlit-based puzzle application

Each app includes:
- Build configuration (Dockerfile, Taskfile, etc.)
- Source code
- Tests

### `libs/`
Reusable libraries and build tools. For example:

- `rules_task/`: Bazel rule set or CLI helper scripts to simplify task execution, builds, or image packaging
- `ansible/`: Shared Ansible roles and filters.

### `third_party/`
All external, vendored dependencies.

- `hermit/`: Binaries manager
- `python/`: `requirements.txt` and any vendored wheels
- `javascript/`: JS/NPM dependencies
- `manifests/`: Vendored upstream Kubernetes manifests using Kustomize

## üöÄ Task-Based Entrypoint

All repo commands are executed via [`task`](https://taskfile.dev). It‚Äôs the single interface for:

- Building apps
- Testing libs
- Deploying services or full stacks
- Managing infra provisioning

### Example Usage

```bash
task stacks:devenv:apply    # Apply the devenv stack locally
task stacks:enigma:apply    # Apply the enigma Talos-based cluster stack
```

Run `task --list` for a full list of available commands.

## üèÉ Running the Repository

This repository uses [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage environment variables and ensure the correct binaries are available in your PATH. All tools and dependencies are downloaded just-in-time (JIT) when needed.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install direnv**: Follow the [installation guide](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) for your platform.

2. **Hook direnv into your shell**: Add the appropriate hook to your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   # For zsh (add to ~/.zshrc)
   eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
   
   # For bash (add to ~/.bashrc)
   eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
   
   # For fish (add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish)
   direnv hook fish | source
   ```

3. **Restart your shell** or source your configuration file.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone and enter the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/setup
   ```

2. **Allow direnv to load the environment**:
   ```bash
   direnv allow
   ```
   
   This will automatically:
   - Set up the required environment variables
   - Download and make available all necessary binaries in your PATH
   - Configure the development environment

3. **Verify the setup**:
   ```bash
   task --list
   ```

### How It Works

- **Automatic Environment Setup**: When you `cd` into the repository, direnv automatically loads the environment configuration
- **JIT Binary Downloads**: Required tools (like `task`, `kubectl`, `helm`, etc.) are downloaded on-demand when first used
- **Isolated Environment**: All tools and dependencies are contained within the repository, avoiding conflicts with system-wide installations
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works consistently across macOS, Linux, and other supported platforms

### Troubleshooting

- **If commands are not found**: Ensure direnv is properly hooked into your shell and run `direnv reload`
- **If environment seems stale**: Run `direnv reload` to refresh the environment
- **To see what direnv is doing**: Use `direnv status` to check the current state

## Best Practices

### Kubernetes File Naming Convention

Format: `<kind>-<name>.yaml`

Examples:
- deployment-app.yaml
- deployment-worker.yaml
- service-app.yaml
- configmap-env.yaml
- secret-db.yaml
- cronjob-cleanup.yaml

### Code Formatting & Checking

This repo uses the [Trunk CLI](https://docs.trunk.io/code-quality/code-quality)
for consistent formatting and linting. Run `trunk fmt` to automatically format
your changes and `trunk check` to run the configured linters.

### Maintaining AGENTS.md

Whenever you create a new package or move an existing one within the repository, update `AGENTS.md` to reflect the current structure. Keeping this file in sync ensures contributors understand the latest layout.
