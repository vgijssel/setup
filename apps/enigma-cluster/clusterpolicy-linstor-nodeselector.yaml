    policies.kyverno.io/title: Add NodeSelector to LinstorCluster
    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Mutates the LinstorCluster resource to add a nodeSelector that restricts
      linstor satellite pods to only run on nodes labeled with linstor.storage=enabled.
      This prevents linstor storage pods from scheduling on gateway nodes while still
      allowing metrics collection pods to run on all nodes.
