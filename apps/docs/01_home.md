# Hello and welcome!

## What is this place?!

This is my personal blog where I write about my experiences, failures, successes and other things that interest me. It also houses documentation for all of my experiments and projects. I hope you find something useful here.

## About Me

![[./images/about-me.jpeg|400]]

I am a passionate developer with a strong focus on delivering business value. I’m good at learning new languages, technologies and tools to innovatively solve new and existing problems. I have substantial subject matter experience in security, securing systems, data and CI/CD. I’m a natural problem solver with an easy personality who likes to get things done.
