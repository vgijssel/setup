Add workspace presets for specialized AI agent roles

This adds two new Coder workspace presets that provide specialized system prompts for different use cases:

1. "Coder" preset - Optimized for software development tasks with focus on implementing features, writing tests, and maintaining code quality
2. "Operator" preset - Optimized for incident investigation and troubleshooting with focus on diagnostics, root cause analysis, and SRE practices

These presets allow users to quickly create workspaces tailored for specific workflows without manually configuring system prompts.
