  description: >
    Manage Lights based on room presence.
    When there is no presence turn off the lights.
    When there is presence, within the time range and below the wanted illuminance, turn on the lights.
    While there is presence and the lights have been turned on, don't turn them off until presence is lost.
    This is a continuous process and checked every 1 minute.
    If the lights are operated outside of this automation then for the duration of the presence,
    the light is marked with manual override, meaning the automation won't turn it on/off anymore.
    Once presence is off, the manual override is removed.
