**TL;DR If you are thinking about using the Raspberry Pi 4 (Pi) which hosts PiKVM for multiple use cases, just get a second Pi. It will save you a lot of time.**

Having **not** read the [PiKVM](https://docs.pikvm.org/) documentation thoroughly (reading _is_ hard after all) I decided to purchase the [Geekworm KVM-A3](https://wiki.geekworm.com/KVM-A3) with a Pi 8GiB instead of the recommend 1GiB to host both the PiKVM OS and [Windmill](https://www.windmill.dev/) inside of [K3S](https://k3s.io). I was about to learn this was actually a lot harder than I imagined it would be.

## Windmill in PiKVM Host OS

PiKVM is based on Arch Linux, which supports K3s. The only notable difference? Its read-only filesystem! Let's change that.

#### Steps

1. Circumvent read-only file system as described [here](https://docs.pikvm.org/faq/). (Tip: Look for instructions between the giant warning banners üòÇ).
   ![[pikvm-read-write-warning.png]]
1. Install K3s
1. Setup [helmfile](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with the Windmill chart
1. Run `helmfile apply`
1. Watch it fail ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### Result

I was surprised it took a really long time to start the Windmill pods. Checking out the kubectl logs I came to the realisation that k3s was unable to pull an image from the registry due to a mismatch in architecture. The [Windmill package](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/pkgs/container/windmill) only supports `arm64`, while PiKVM runs on `armhf`.

> [!tip] Lesson 1
>
> Arm64 and armhf are different architectures, and software compatibility isn‚Äôt guaranteed. Always do your due diligence!

## PiKVM in ESXi-Arm Fling VM

PiKVM doesn't offer a 64-bit version of the OS ([source](https://github.com/pikvm/pi-builder/issues/4), [source](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm/issues/711)), yet I needed to run 64-bit and 32-bit software on the same machine. Enter [ESXi-Arm Fling](https://williamlam.com/2024/10/new-esxi-arm-fling-based-on-8-0-update-3b.html). Success guaranteed of course, as ESXi is built and maintained by a reputable company.

#### Steps

1. Create an account on [the Broadcom website](https://access.broadcom.com/default/ui/v1/signin/) and download the documentation
2. From the documentation
   1. Update Raspberry Pi 4 EEPROM
   2. Flash UEFI to sdcard from [https://github.com/pftf/RPi4/releases](https://github.com/pftf/RPi4/releases)
   3. Make OSData partition 25gb by passing this in the boot screen (to not have ESXi take all the space in the thumb-drive)
      ```
      systemMediaSize=min
      ```
   4. When asked for a ESX OSData store when installing on a USB attached disk press enter to skip this, otherwise you'll get a cryptic error and have to start over.
3. Get license code from [https://gist.github.com/ayebrian/646775424393c9a35fb8257f44df1c8b](https://gist.github.com/ayebrian/646775424393c9a35fb8257f44df1c8b) who is kind enough to share it with the rest of the world.
4. Add license code to ESXi
5. [Download official PiKVM v3 image](https://files.pikvm.org/images/v3-hdmi-rpi4-box-latest.img.xz -O pikvm-rpi4.img.xz)
6. Convert the image to vmdk
   ```bash
   qemu-img convert -f raw -O vmdk ~/Downloads/v3-hdmi-rpi4-box-latest.img ~/Downloads/v3-hdmi-rpi4-box-latest.vmdk
   ```
7. Upload `v3-hdmi-rpi4-box-latest.vmdk`
8. Configure the `pikvm` virtual machine
   ![[esxi-vm-settings.png]]
9. Attach the uploaded disk to the virtual machine
10. Boot the machine
11. Watch if fail ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### Result

The VM wouldn‚Äôt boot‚Äîa 32-bit PiKVM image can‚Äôt run as a 64-bit VM. I also tried to run the virtual machine with the Debian net installer: [https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/arm64/iso-cd/](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/arm64/iso-cd/) and trying add grub to the root file system, but with no success.

> ESXi doesn't support 32-bit arm VMs ([source](https://williamlam.com/2020/10/how-to-run-raspberry-pi-os-as-a-vm-on-esxi-arm.html), [source](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=250308#c2)).

## PiKVM in Pimox VM

Pimox (Proxmox + Pi) seemed promising based on [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/nvdb1z/proxmox_on_the_raspberry_pi_now_supports_32bit/) with support for 32-bit VMs.

#### Steps

1. Install Pimox ([source](https://github.com/jiangcuo/Proxmox-Port), [source](https://fleetstack.io/blog/install-proxmox-on-raspberry-pi), [source](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-proxmox), [source](https://gist.github.com/enjikaka/52d62c9c5462748dbe35abe3c7e37f9a), [source](https://www.bachmann-lan.de/proxmox-8-auf-dem-raspberry-pi-4-installieren/)) ^pimox-install
2. Create and run an Ansible Playbook (see [pull request](https://github.com/vgijssel/setup/pull/676)) ^pimox-ansible
3. Initialise a Proxmox VM
4. Search for the device passthrough section to passthrough the following devices:
   - OTG port for keyboard/mouse/mass storage device (msd) emulation on the target the PiKVM is attached to
   - HDMI capture card and hardware H264 encoding for streaming target video output
   - GPIO for ATX control for power on/off control
   - I2C for the OLED screen
5. Fail ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### Result

Hypervisors like Proxmox can‚Äôt easily passthrough all devices from host to guest. I did some reading about [vfio passthrough](https://www.openeuler.org/en/blog/wxggg/2020-11-29-vfio-passthrough-2.html) but that was waaaay out of my comfort zone, so I decided to give up on running PiKVM inside a vm.

Thanks for [helping me set up PiKVM in a vm @srepac](https://discord.com/channels/1138148231180714085/1138148231663067258/1321907940382343209)!

## kvmd-armbian in Pimox Host OS

Suffering from [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) big time I kept pursuing my goal. Determined I found [kvmd-armbian](https://github.com/srepac/kvmd-armbian) which is an unofficial port that supports 32-bit, 64-bit on arm AND x86 machines. Bonus points having a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/64EQQuwjsB) for support.

#### Steps

1. Install Pimox [[#^pimox-install]]
2. Create and run an Ansible Playbook [[#^pimox-ansible]]
3. Run installer from kvmd-armbian ^kvmd-installer
4. Disable the Pimox firewall to get access to the kvmd web ui (Tip: Please enable it again if you plan deploy like this üòÖ)
   ```bash
   pve-firewall stop
   ```
5. [[#Fix OLED screen for kvmd-armbian]]
6. Celebrate üéâ

#### Result

With help from the kvmd-armbian community ‚ù§Ô∏è it worked, but running two unofficial setups (Pimox + kvmd-armbian) in the host OS felt unsustainable. If one of the projects would stop developing I'd have to start over.

> [!tip] Lesson 5
>
> Prioritize long-term maintainability.

## kvmd-armbian in Pimox LXC

If I can't run kvmd-armbian on the host and not in a VM, what are my options? I looked into docker containers and [LXC containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/). As LXC is closer to a vm than Docker and PiKVM has specific host requirements like an additional partition for msd, I decided to go with LXC.

#### Steps

1. Download LXC Jammy and create a container template ([source](https://benheater.com/proxmox-lxc-using-external-templates/))
2. Create an LXC container with the following settings
   - **Hostname**: pikvm
   - UNCHECK - unprivileged container (so **privileged** container)
   - **Password**: Password1234 (Tip: don't)
3. Start the LXC container and attach the console
4. Run kvmd-installer [[#^kvmd-installer]]
5. [[#Fix OLED screen for kvmd-armbian]]
6. Forward devices from host to guest (I have to admit this was _pretty_ time consuming üòÖ)
   1. [[#Passthrough GPIO for ATX control]]
   2. [[#Passthrough OTG port for keyboard/mouse]]
   3. [[#Passthrough HDMI capture card]]
   4. [[#Passthrough I2C for the OLED screen]]
7. Celebrate üéâ

#### Result

This separation enabled easier updates for both host and guest OS, leaving me less worried about potential future breakage.

> [!tip] Lesson 6

> LXC and device passthrough are pretty far out of my comfort zone, I used ChatGPT which was incredibly helpful!

## kvmd-armbian in Incus LXC

Next I decided to see if it's possible to use a hypervisor which is officially supported on arm AND supports LXC out of the box. I investigated the following, not an exhaustive list:

| Hypervisor                                                                                      | Raspberry Pi 4 support                                                                                          | LXC support                                                     |

The choice landed on Incus (see [pull request](https://github.com/vgijssel/setup/pull/679)).

#### Steps

1. Using Raspberry Pi Imager:
   - **OS**: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS 64-bit
   - **Username**: deploy
   - **Hostname**: provisioner
   - **Password**: `Password1234`
2. Setup Incus host using Ansible playbook
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i ./production.local provisioner.yml --diff
   ```
3. Create [[#Incus kvmd-armbian LXC container with passthrough]]
4. Start the LXC container
   ```bash
   incus start kvmd
   ```
5. Run the kvmd-armbian installer [[#^kvmd-installer]]
6. [[#Fix OLED screen for kvmd-armbian]]
7. Restart the container
   ```bash
   incus restart kvmd
   ```
8. Celebrate üéâ

#### Result

A clean, supported hypervisor setup (many kudos to the Incus team üëè). At this point I'm pretty happy. But having spent all this time, it would be a waste not to spend **EVEN MORE** time trying to improve things.

## PiKVM in Incus LXC

Inspired by [pikvm-container](https://github.com/Prototyped/pikvm-container), a (dated) implementation of running PiKVM inside a docker container, I adapted the official PiKVM image for LXC (see [pull request](https://github.com/vgijssel/setup/pull/679) with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)pipeline).

#### Steps

1. [Download official PiKVM v3 image](https://files.pikvm.org/images/v3-hdmi-rpi4-box-latest.img.xz -O pikvm-rpi4.img.xz)
2. Extract partitions using 7zip
3. Loop mount partitions
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /mnt/rootfs
   mkdir -p /mnt/rootfs/boot
   mount -o loop 2.img /mnt/rootfs
   mount -o loop 0.fat /mnt/rootfs/boot
   ```
4. Use [distrobuilder](https://github.com/lxc/distrobuilder) to convert`/mnt/rootfs` into an Incus LXC image with modifications
   1. Remove `/etc/fstab`
   2. Disable msd
   3. A boot helper to generate a certificate
   4. Mask service `kvmd-pst`, `kvmd-fan`, `kvmd-watchdog` and `kvmd-bootconfig` because PiKVM works without those (and I don't want to spend more time fixing those services üòÇ)
5. Import the image into Incus
   ```bash
   incus image import pikvm-rpi4.tar.xz --alias pikvm-rpi4/latest
   ```
6. Create [[#Incus PiKVM LXC container with passthrough]]
7. Check the console for errors
   ```bash
   incus console pikvm --show-log
   ```
8. Celebrate üéâ

#### Result

Success! I'm running an officially supported hypervisor and a _hacky_-officially supported installation of PiKVM inside an LXC container! Now I can get back to what I was doing, spinning up Windmill.

## Closing Thoughts

Thanks to the kvmd-armbian community, Google, Reddit, and ChatGPT, I‚Äôve gained invaluable insights into the Raspberry Pi, hypervisors, and device passthrough. Would I recommend this journey? Probably not‚Äîjust get a second Pi for PiKVM. But where‚Äôs the fun in that? üòÜ

systemctl enable /usr/lib/systemd/system/kvmd-oled-shutdown.service
```

##### Passthrough GPIO for ATX control

1. I used the output of `journalctl -f` to figure out where kvmd-armbian would break:

```bash
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: File "/usr/bin/kvmd", line 8, in <module>
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: sys.exit(main())
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/kvmd/apps/kvmd/__init__.py", line 75, in main
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: KvmdServer(
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/kvmd/apps/kvmd/server.py", line 263, in run
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: comp.sysprep()
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/kvmd/apps/kvmd/ugpio.py", line 294, in sysprep
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: driver.prepare()
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/kvmd/plugins/ugpio/gpio.py", line 86, in prepare
	Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: self.__chip = gpiod.Chip(self.__device_path) Dec 29 19:36:40 pikvm kvmd[602]: PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
```

2. Running `kvmd -m` showed me what gpio device what was spected
   ```yaml
   kvmd:
     atx:
       device: /dev/gpiochip0
   ```
3. Update the LXC template
   ```yaml
   # 254 is the major number as can be seen by the ls command OR stat /dev/gpiochip0
   lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow = c 254:* rwm
   lxc.mount.entry = /dev/gpiochip0 dev/gpiochip0 none bind,optional,create=file
   ```
4. Restart the LXC using the UI
5. Works!

##### Passthrough OTG port for keyboard/mouse

1. Failure from `journalctl`
   ```bash

   Dec 30 04:52:48 pikvm kvmd-otg[182]:     os.mkdir(path)
   Dec 30 04:52:48 pikvm kvmd-otg[182]: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/kvmd'
   ```
2. Check which devices are expected from `kvmd -m`

   ```yaml
   hid:
     keyboard:
       device: /dev/kvmd-hid-keyboard

     mouse:
       device: /dev/kvmd-hid-mouse

     mouse_alt:
       device: /dev/kvmd-hid-mouse-alt
   ```

3. Ensure kernel module in the host `i2c-dev` is loaded
4. Mount `/sys/kernel/config` in LXC by updating the template
   ```yaml
   lxc.mount.entry: /sys/kernel/config sys/kernel/config none bind,optional
   # 236 is the major group of the hidg* devices
   lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 236:* rwm
   ```
5. Once the `kvmd-otg` service starts the usb_gadget devices are created in the host, not in the guest
   ```bash
   crw-rw----  1 root kvmd    236,   0 Dec 30 15:52 hidg0
   crw-rw----  1 root kvmd    236,   1 Dec 30 15:52 hidg1
   crw-rw----  1 root kvmd    236,   2 Dec 30 15:52 hidg2
   ```
6. Now it's a bit of a üêî and ü•ö situation, where we need the `/dev/hidg*` devices to exist on the host before starting the container. But once the container starts these devices are created on the host üòÖ. Therefore inside the LXC we need to add these devices manually
   ```bash
   mknod /dev/kvmd-hid-keyboard c 236 0
   mknod /dev/kvmd-hid-mouse c 236 1
   mknod /dev/kvmd-hid-mouse-alt c 236 2
   ```
7. Ensure the permissions on these devices are correct so the kvmd group can control them
   ```bash
   chown root:kvmd /dev/kvmd-hid-keyboard /dev/kvmd-hid-mouse /dev/kvmd-hid-mouse-alt
   chmod 0660  /dev/kvmd-hid-keyboard /dev/kvmd-hid-mouse /dev/kvmd-hid-mouse-alt
   ```
8. Login to the web UI validate that the keyboard works! (Note the kvmd is attached to a server, so unable to test the mouse)

##### Passthrough HDMI capture card

   ```
2. The error message mentions the relevant device!
3. Update the LXC template
   ```yaml
   lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 81:* rwm
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video0 dev/kvmd-video none bind,optional,create=file
   ```
4. Restart the LXC
5. Now we see a different error
   ```
   Dec 30 05:32:21 pikvm kvmd[237]: kvmd.apps.kvmd.streamer           INFO --- => -- INFO  [36989.079          ] -- H264: Configuring encoder: DMA=1 ...
   Dec 30 05:32:21 pikvm kvmd[237]: kvmd.apps.kvmd.streamer           INFO --- => -- ERROR [36989.079          ] -- H264: Can't open encoder device: No such file or directory
   Dec 30 05:32:21 pikvm kvmd[237]: kvmd.apps.kvmd.streamer           INFO --- => -- ERROR [36989.079          ] -- H264: Encoder destroyed due an error (prepare)
   ```
6. This is because the H264 encoder is a separate video device on the Raspberry Pi. I decided to simply passthrough all video devices, but there is probably a smarter way to go about this üôà
   ```yaml
   lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 81:* rwm
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video0  dev/kvmd-video none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video10 dev/video10 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video11 dev/video11 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video12 dev/video12 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video13 dev/video13 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video14 dev/video14 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video15 dev/video15 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video16 dev/video16 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video18 dev/video18 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video19 dev/video19 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video20 dev/video20 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video21 dev/video21 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video22 dev/video22 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video23 dev/video23 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/video31 dev/video31 none bind,optional,create=file
   ```
7. Restart the LXC
8. Navigate to the web UI and validate it works üéâ

##### Passthrough I2C for the OLED screen

1. `journalctl` and `systemctl` didn't show the `kvmd-oled` service
2. Running `systemctl start kvmd-oled` showed the problem, the device `/dev/i2c-1` didn't exist

```bash
Jan 08 09:14:13 pikvm systemd[1]: PiKVM - A small OLED daemon was skipped because of an unmet condition check (ConditionPathExists=/dev/i2c-1).
```

3. Easy peasy! Update the LXC template
   ```yaml
   lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 89:* rwm
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/i2c-1 dev/i2c-1 none bind,optional,create=file 0 0
   ```
4. Restart the LXC
5. BOOM
