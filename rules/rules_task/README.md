# rules_task

`rules_task` is a Bazel ruleset for creating and running programs called tasks. It aims to be a simpler alternative than writing `sh_binary` targets and look similar to scripts you would write for CI/CD systems like GitHub and GitLab.

# Inspiration/Alternatives

- [task](https://github.com/go-task/task) - Having used this tool for a while, I took some of the best parts and ported them to Bazel in rules_task.
